// question: Write a program that takes a student's average as an input
// which is a floating point value, and prints A if the average is in the
// range 80-100, B if the average is in the range 60-80
// print F if the average is in the range 0-60
// if the value is not in the range of 0-100, the program should print
// a message to signal an invalid input

# include <stdio.h>
# include <stdlib.h>

int main(){

    float score = 0;

    printf("What is the score of the student? ");

    scanf("%f", &score);

    if (score >= 80.0 && score <= 100.0){

        printf("The score is A.\n");

    }else if(score < 80.0 && score >= 60.0 ){

        printf("The score is B.\n");

    }else if (score < 60.0 && score >= 0.0) {

        printf("The score is F.\n");

    }else{

        printf("The score value is invalid.\n");
