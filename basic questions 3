//question: For this exercise you should be able to write a logical expression
//which checks if some integer x consists of exactly 5 digits.
// Ex: 30498 and -14004 are 5-digit numbers,
// while 1098, -1 and 34 are not
// The program should end when 0 is the input. The following is an example of the
// execution of your program

# include <stdio.h>
# include <stdlib.h>

int main(){

    int number;

    do{

        printf("Please input an integer: \n");
        scanf("%d", &number);

        if(number/10000 > 1 && number/10000 < 10){

            printf("You input is a five-digit number: %d \n", number);

        }
    }while(number != 0);

    printf("Thank you for using my software. Bye! ");

    return 0;
}
